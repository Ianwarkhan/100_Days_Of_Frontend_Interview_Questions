55. ### What is universal selector in css?
      The universal selector is a css selector that can be used to apply styles to all elements on a page or to reset styles for all elements to their default values

## Day 12

56. ### Explain the difference between classes and IDs in CSS.
      Classes are used to group together elements with similar styles, while IDs are used to target specific elements on a page. IDs must be unique, while classes can be used multiple times on a page.

57. ### Explain box model in CSS.
      The box model in CSS is a way of representing elements as boxes with content, padding, borders, and margins. The content area is the actual content of the element, the padding is the space between the content and the border, the border is a line around the element, and the margin is the space between the border and the surrounding elements.

58. ### What is the difference between margin and padding in CSS?
      Margin is the space between the border of an element and the surrounding elements, while padding is the space between the content of an element and its border.

59. ### Explain the CSS display property and its values.
      The CSS display property controls how an element is displayed on a page. The possible values are block, inline, inline-block, none, and others.

60. ### What is the CSS position property and its values?
      The CSS position property controls how an element is positioned on a page. The possible values are static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky

## Day 13

61. ### What is the difference between absolute and relative positioning in CSS?
      Relative positioning moves an element relative to its current position without affecting the position of other elements, while absolute positioning positions an element relative to its closest parent element, potentially affecting the position of other elements.

62. ### Explain the CSS float property and its values.
       The CSS float property controls the alignment of an element in a page layout. The possible values include left, right, none, and inherit. When an element is floated left or right, other elements will flow around it.

63. ### What is the CSS clear property?
      The CSS clear property controls whether an element is allowed to float next to another element or not. The possible values include left, right, both, and none. When an element is cleared, it will be moved below any floated elements.

64. ### What is the CSS z-index property?
      The CSS z-index property controls the stacking order of elements on a page. Elements with a higher z-index value are displayed on top of elements with a lower z-index value. The default value of z-index is auto.

65. ### What are CSS pseudo-classes? Give some examples.
      CSS pseudo-classes are selectors that target elements based on their state or position in the document. Some examples include :hover, :active, :focus, :first-child, :last-child, and :nth-child.

## Day 14
66. ### What is CSS animation?
      CSS animation is a way to add movement and dynamism to the HTML element on a web pages using CSS. It is used to enhance users experience.

67. ### How do you define a CSS animation?
      We can define CSS animation by creating a set of keyframes that specify the start and end states of an animation. We can apply the animation to an element using the animation property in css.

68. ### How do you trigger a CSS animation to start and stop?
      You can trigger a CSS animation to start and stop using various CSS selectors and events. For example, you can use the :hover pseudo-class to start an animation when a user hovers over an element.

69. ### How do you create a responsive CSS animation?
      We can create responsive CSS animation by using relative units like percentages instead of fixed units like pixels. We can also use media queries to adjust the animation properties based on the size of the viewport.

70. ### How do you optimize CSS animations for performance?
      We can optimize CSS animation for performance by using techniques like reducing the number of elements being animated, minimizing the use of box-shadow and text-shadow, and using transform and opacity instead of top, left, bottom, and right.

## Day 15
71. ### How do you debug CSS animations and troubleshoot common issues, such as animations not playing or playing too quickly?
      We can debug CSS animations by checking for typos or syntax errors, checking browser's compatibility if it supports the property or not,  checking for code that may override the animation.

72. ### What is transition in CSS?
      A transition in CSS is a way to create animation effects when a property of an HTML element changes, allowing developers to smoothly animate changes to an element's style over a specified duration.

73. ### Can you specify multiple CSS transitions for an element?
       Yes, you can specify multiple CSS transitions for an element by separating them with commas in the "transition" property.

74. ### What are gradients in CSS?
      It is a property of CSS which allows you to display a smooth transformation between two or more than two specified colors. There are two types of gradients in CSS. They are: Linear gradient and radial gradient.

75. ### What is the difference between linear and radial gradient in CSS?
      A linear gradient creates a smooth transition between two or more colors in a straight line while the radial gradient creates a smooth transition between two or more colors in a circular shape.

## Day 16

76. ### What is flexbox?
      Flexbox is a CSS3 layout module which provides more flexible and efficient way to align arrange and align the elements within the container. It is widely supported by the modern web browser.

77. ### What is the difference between flex-grow and flex-shrink properties in Flexbox?
      `flex-grow` is a property in Flexbox that specifies how much a flex item should grow relative to the other items in the container, while `flex-shrink` specifies how much a flex item should shrink relative to the other items when there is not enough space available in the container.

78. ### What is the difference between flex-wrap: nowrap and overflow: hidden in CSS?
      `flex-wrap: nowrap` prevents flex items from wrapping to the next line when they overflow the container, while `overflow: hidden` hides any content that overflows the container's boundaries.

79. ### What is the `gap` property in Flexbox, and how is it used to add spacing between flex items?
      The `gap` property in Flexbox sets the spacing between flex items, both horizontally and vertically. It is a shorthand for `row-gap` and `column-gap`.

80. ### How do you center an element using flexbox?
      To center an element using flexbox, we need to set the parent container's display property to `flex` and use the `justify-content` & `align-items` properties with the value of `center`.

## Day 17

81. ### What is CSS grid?
      CSS grid is a layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex, multi-dimensional grid layouts for web pages.

82. ### How do you use the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties to define the size and number of columns and rows in a grid?
      You can use the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties to define the size and number of columns and rows in a grid. For example, you might define a grid with three columns, where the first column is 100 pixels wide, the second column is 50% of the available width, and the third column takes up the remaining space, with the following CSS:

      ```
      grid-template-columns: 100px 50% 1fr;
      ```
83. ### How do you specify the number of columns in a grid using CSS?
      You can specify the number of columns in a grid by using the `grid-template-columns` property. For example, `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` will create a grid with three columns that are each one fraction of the available space.

84. ### How do you align items within a grid using CSS?
      You can align items within a grid using the `justify-items` and `align-items` properties. justify-items aligns items horizontally within a grid, while `align-items` aligns items vertically.

85. ### What is the difference between grid-row and grid-column in CSS Grid?
      `grid-row` is used to position an item within a row, while `grid-column` is used to position an item within a column. Both properties can take a value of either a number or a named grid line.


# Day 18

86. ### What is a CSS transition?
      A CSS transition is a way to add a gradual animation effect to an element when its CSS properties change. 

87. ### What is the purpose of the `transition-property` property in CSS transitions?
      The `transition-property` property specifies which CSS property or properties should be transitioned when a change occurs.

88. ### What is the function of the `transition-timing-function` property in CSS transitions?
      The `transition-timing-function` property specifies the rate of change of the transition over time. This can be used to control the speed of the transition and how it accelerates and decelerates. Example: `ease-in`, `ease`, `ease-out`.

89. ### How do you delay the start of a CSS transition?
      You can delay the start of a CSS transition using the transition-delay property. This property specifies the amount of time to wait before starting the transition, in seconds or milliseconds. Example: `transition-delay: 1s;`

90. ### How do you apply a transition to multiple properties at once?
      You can apply a transition to multiple properties at once by separating the property names with commas in the `transition-property` property. example, `transition-property: background-color, color, opacity;`

# Day 19

91. ### What are CSS 2D Transforms?
      CSS 2D Transforms are a set of properties that allow you to transform the position, rotation, scaling, and skewing of an element in two dimensions, without affecting the surrounding elements.

92. ### Can you use negative values with CSS 2D transforms? If so, what effect do they have?
      Yes, you can use negative values with CSS 2D transforms. The effect of negative values depends on the function being used. For example, a negative value for the `rotate()` function will rotate the element counterclockwise instead of clockwise.

93. ### What are the properties of CSS 2D transform?
      The properties of CSS 2D Transforms are:
      1. transform: specifies the transformation functions to be applied to an element
      2. transform-origin: specifies the point around which the transformation should occur
      3. translate: moves an element along the x-axis and/or y-axis
      4. rotate: rotates an element clockwise or counterclockwise around a given point
      5. scale: increases or decreases the size of an element
      6. skew: skews an element along the x-axis and/or y-axis

94. ### Can you apply multiple transformations to the same element using CSS 2D transforms?
      Yes, you can apply multiple transformations to the same element using CSS 2D transforms. You can do this by separating each transformation function with a space in the `transform` property.

95. ### What is the difference between the `translate()` and `rotate()` functions?
      The `translate()` function is used to move an element along the x-axis and/or y-axis, while the `rotate()` function is used to rotate an element clockwise or counterclockwise around a given point.
